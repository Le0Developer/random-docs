# Code Snippets

Code Snippets allow you to auto-complete the function definitions in your IDE.

## Installing Code Snippets

To install code snippets, download the `snippets.json` file from the
documentation page.

Then, follow the instructions for your specific IDE:

<article>
	<header>VSCode</header>

1.  Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
2.  Type "Snippets: Configure Snippets" and select it.
3.  Choose "New Global Snippets file..." or "New Snippets file for
    'project'...".
4.  Name the file (anything will work).
5.  Copy the contents of the downloaded `snippets.json` into this file and save.
