# Accuracy

The software covered is multiple years old and thus lacks official
documentation. The documentation provided here is essentially written by a
single person and may contain inaccuracies or incomplete information.

## Support

**We cannot help you with coding or scripting issues from the software.**

We can't help you learn Lua/Javascript, debug your scripts or advice on how to
use the software. We very likely haven't touched it ourselves in years. This is
just a reference and we do not have the resources to provide support for coding
issues.

## Mistakes or Omissions

If you think we made a mistake or left something out, please help us improve the
documentation by submitting an issue or a pull request on GitHub. The link can
be found in the footer.
